            <h1>Vietnamese restaurant</h1>
            <p>Inspired by Vietnamese street food. We opened the take away restaurant Hanoi Alley, in early 2022 in
                Nørrebro in
                Copenhagen. The small oasis is run by Thu Hien, an experienced restaurant owner from Vietnam, where she
                ran two popular
                restaurant chains Ngo 89 and 1976.

                Hanoi Alley offers an authentic and intimate environment – ​a cozy decorated restaurant with a small
                menu, where you
                will find the most authentic Vietnamese dishes, made with love and dedication.</p>

            <p>Vietnamese street food expresses the beauty of the Vietnamese culture, lifestyle, feelings and thoughts.
                This is the
                foundation of the experience you will get at Hanoi Alleys, a rare breath of fresh air on the Copenhagen
                restaurant
                scene. To ensure that the taste remains fresh and authentic, our dishes are not made in advance.
                This also ensures to highlight the natural taste of the ingredients. You are greeted by a balanced
                flavor combination,
                highlighted by the contrasts of sour, spicy, salty and sweet, which helps to elevate the culinary
                experience.

                You can either eat in the restaurant or order take away. Call us to order your food or visit our
                restaurant in the heart
                of Nørrebro.

                We also offer catering for smaller parties if you miss the authentic taste of Vietnam for your party or
                dinner party.
                You can either be inspired by our menu on our website, or we will be happy to put together a special
                menu for you.
